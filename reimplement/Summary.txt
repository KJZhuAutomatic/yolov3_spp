Darknet类有两个主要成员函数：__init__, forward

	__init__需要两个函数: parse_cofig, create_modules

		parse_cofig: 
		create_modules:

	forward calls forward func of each modules sequentially. 


nms func's pipeline:
	
	discard some pred according to confidence threshold
	discard some pred with too small/large width/height
	if multi_label:
		for the multi class, repeat the box pred if conf > threshold
	else:
		choose the largest conf class for box, then discard conf < threshold
	multi_class nms 

image pre/post process:
	pre process: resize image as large size equal to input size, 
	             and keep aspect ratio, record scale ratio
	letter box: put resized image a required size (width and height multi of 32 if rect or input_size X input_size) , record pad value 
	post process: rescale boxes coordinate with ratio and pad value, 
				  or recompute it with original and processed image size.

dataset func:
	__init__:
		construct image file list and label file list
			check:
				image file format suffix
				
		record the shape of image in image file list
		if rectangular train, compute batch shape 
		cache labels and images (optional)

	__getitem__:
		if mosaic mosaic_load else image_load
		if augment, random_affine(xyxy label is required), hsv_augment
		label normalize
		image and label  left right flip if augment
		put image index in label

build_target:
	for every yolo layer output:
		get yolo layer normalized anchors
		remap targets(normalized) to grid size
		compute wh_iou of anchors and targets and choose which larger than threshold
		choosed target [image_idx, cls, grid_x, grid_y, grid_w, grid_h],record:
			target_box [grid_xy-grid_ji, grid_wh]
			target_cls [cls]
			indices [image_idx, anchor_idx, grid_i, grid_j]
			anchor [num_target, 2] [anchor_w, anchor_h]

compute_loss:
	for every layer output:
		for indices(positive sample) giou with prediction and target boxes
		construct target_obj in indices is weighted giou, other is 0
		construct target_cls for positive sample 
		BCE(pred_obj, target_obj)
		for positive sample:
			loss_box = 1 - giou
			loss_cls = BCE(pred_cls, target_cls)
	weighted losses

Improvement:
	my nms and remap_coords √
	COCO evaluate a subset of dataset

note:
	the type of indices
	torch.zeros(*size) √  torch.zeros(shape=(a,b)) ×
	IMPORTANT: when get partial data which meets the requirement, e.g torch.nonzero
				pay attention to case that no data be gotten. In yolov3_spp.compute_loss, I was received loss of value nan, because of None of positive sample.
				TODO nms func  √ Only indices is fine, compute will generate nan.
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Very fool error but waste time much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				array[:, inds] and array[range(n), inds] is different, see
				train_utils.train_eval_utils line 73.
				two error in reimplement.utils nms func line 48,90.
				an very fool error in reimplement.utils xyxy2xywh.
	exp().clamp(max=), specify a reasonable max value to avoid overflow
	when coding, record the completed testing to clear up .


training: my data use mosaic(my own) and no affine augment mAP decrease.
		  his data use mosaic and and no affine augment to keep mAP.
		  conclusion:
		  	  use my implementation of model, loss and nms, just dataset comparison with the well trained weight, finetune 2 epochs with small lr, compare the estimation mAP
		  	  hisdatamosaic > hisdatarect = mydatamosaic > mydatarect
		  TODO
		  	  Well structured code to git repo and compare his and my code √
		  Now my rect not bad, mosaic should be improve.
		  		rect train freeze is Ok, try affine augment to improve 
		  		mosaic
		  	I will structured git repo, and find the error in dataset target and compute_loss.

mosaic procession:
	random uniform sample the coords of center
	for every image:
		resize to longer size = img_size, record height and width 
		align the corner, and compute the clamped region in image and mosaic image.
		paste the image, and record pad value
		convert the normalized coords to mosaic image:
			xywh -> xyxy -> gain(h, w) -> pad 
	concat the converted coords, clip out of mosaic image size

一直记住目标，目的要时刻明确清晰
从结果反推回去需要的变量，不需要的立马删除掉
从后面看要的做的，不如早作划分
需要的不容易分离出来，先一步剔除一些肯定不要的，这属于反向考虑目标
拥有一些条件，要达到一个目标，可以从两个方向，很多角度思路逻辑来解决这件事
